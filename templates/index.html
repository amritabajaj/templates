 <h2>About me</h2>
 <p>A posgraduate student at Warwick, studying MSc in eBusiness management. My spcecialism is e commerce and i am currently coding and feeling really really smart about it. I am also looking forward to knowing more about HTML and CSS and what all we can do with learning these essential prramming languages.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>  
 <p>My favourite hobby is doing timepass. I like to read and go to the gym (SOMETIMES). I make really nice candles and want to share this hobby with other people. I love listening to music and having a very chill vibe especcialy after the end of the day and also light a nice cozy candle. Currently i am looking for a part time job because i love money and need more of it to enjoy the expensive like that i want for myself and what i deserve</p>

<h2>What i like?</h2>
<p> I really like Pav bhaji, i love candles and also love making them. I like to be in nature and soend my time alone but i have not been doing that lately so i really should. I am liking this coding thing and i want to have a really nice page and it should be looking really nice. I love it when the sun is out and then i can feel the warmth and how cosy everything get instantly.</p>

<p>I also like helping people, pottery and lately i have been enjoying cooking but i should be eating a little less spicy food. Shopping and travelling are what i love and can do them for days and days</p>

<p>The three main parts of an element are: 

Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag to create a paragraph. 
Content – this is the output that other users see. 
Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example,to end a paragraph. </p>
